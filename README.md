# election-analysis
Module 3 written with Python, election analysis
This election analysys took several steps to find the winner using VS Code.
First we allowed the CSV file to work in VS Code and created several steps to ID the candidates, counties and number of votes for each candidate.  We then printed these results in a newly created txt file called election analysis.  We commited to GitHub along the way using the terminal.
Upon totaling and finding percentages of votes for each candidate, we identified the winner and their percentage of votes and printed these findings to the election_analysis.txt file we created.  We used new line notations and rounded our percentages to the nearest tenth.
Thw winner of the election is DIane DeGette with 73.8% of the votes.
